# About Me

Now I am a Ph.D. candidate of [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no/people/chengjielu), Norway, where I work with [Dr. Tao Yue](https://www.simula.no/people/tao?f%5Bauthor%5D=2737) and [Dr. Shaukat Ali](https://www.simula.no/people/shaukat?f%5Bauthor%5D=2737) in the field of Autonomous Driving System Testing.

<!--  [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no), Norway, and I work as a Research Fellow at -->

<!-- I received my B.Sc. degree in [College of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/) in June 2019 from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn/). In the same year, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree in Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, under the supervision of Prof. Tao Yue. -->
