# About Me

Now I am a Ph.D. candidate of [University of Oslo](https://safdaraqeel.github.io/www.uio.no), Norway, and I worked as a Research Fellow at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no), Norway, where I worked with [Dr. Tao Yue](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=zTDRGDcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Shaukat Ali](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=S_UVLhUAAAAJ&hl=en) in the field of Autonomous Driving System Testing.

I received my B.Sc. degree in [College of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/) in June 2019 from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn/). In the same year, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree in Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, under the supervision of Prof. Tao Yue.
