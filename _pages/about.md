# About Me

 I am currently pursuing a PhD at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no/) and [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no), Norway, under the supervision of [Dr. Shaukat Ali](https://www.simula.no/people/shaukat?f%5Bauthor%5D=2737) and [Dr. Are Magnus Bruaset](https://www.simula.no/people/arem). My research focuses on ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous systems, particularly in autonomous driving and robotics, through automated test generation, uncertainty quantification, and foundation models to build robust and reliable systems.

 Beyond academia, I have applied these methods in industrial and societal contexts, gaining experience in leading technical projects, collaborating with international insititues, including [PAL Robotics](https://pal-robotics.com/), [Danish Technological Institute](https://www.dti.dk/), and [Cancer Registry of Norway](https://www.fhi.no/en/cancer/).
